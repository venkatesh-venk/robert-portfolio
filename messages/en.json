      "description": "The homeless center Open Door at 3535 Avenue du Parc serves 50-70 individuals daily but has significant limitations. It operates only during the day with just 30 beds, leaving many outside. This has led to increased drug use, theft, aggressive begging, and public hygiene issues. We are committed to moving the facility to a more suitable location with expanded capacity."
